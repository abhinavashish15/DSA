# Java Array :

This repository contains a simple Java project demonstrating the use of arrays in Java. 
Arrays are a fundamental data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a collection of elements. It isused to group related data items, making it easier to manage and manipulate a collection of elements.

## Declaring an Array: 
You declare an array by specifying the type of its elements, followed by the array name and square brackets "[]"
Example:
int[] myArray; // Declaration of an integer array

## Initializing an Array
You can initialize an array at the time of declaration or later using the "new" keyword along with the array type and size
